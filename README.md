# Kowalt Framework

Welcome to **Kowalt** – a Python framework centered on dynamic and flexible *Values*. Featuring its unique mascot, **TeleBuzezz**, Kowalt aims to provide developers with an intuitive and powerful base for building scalable applications and systems.

## Overview

At the heart of Kowalt lies the concept of **Values**: configurable entities that can be easily changed, tracked, or interacted with. Values simplify application state management, allowing you to focus on your business logic while Kowalt handles the mechanics of updating and propagating changes.

#### Mascot: **TeleBuzezz**
Meet TeleBuzezz, the friendly robot bee who guides you through Kowalt’s workflow! TeleBuzezz represents the agility and connectivity that Values offer in your software projects.

## Features

- **Dynamic Values:** Easily create and modify Values that reflect your application state.
- **Reactive Architecture:** When Values change, listeners and dependents can react/
- **Pythonic API:** Designed with readability and developer experience in mind.
- **Extensible:** Add your own Value types and mechanisms as your project grows.

## Why Kowalt?

- **Simplicity & Power:** Manage state with minimal code, but maximum flexibility.
- **Inspired by Nature:** Like TeleBuzezz, Values connect and propagate through your system organically.
- **Community-driven:** Contributions and feedback are welcome! Let’s grow Kowalt together.
